# cacheBuffer-DESIGN-USING-C-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE

Hey ! It is my first assignment from "Data Structures and Algorithm" class that I took at Yildiz Technical University. This repository contains; code of program , screenshots while it is processing , and Assignment's description. You can easily understand program's run logic from comments where is written in the .c file. And there are some paint drawings about functions I coded. After all you can always send me e-mails about this repository.
