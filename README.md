# cacheBuffer-DESIGN-USING-C-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE

Hey ! It is my first assignment from "Data Structures and Algorithm" class that I took at Yildiz Technical University. This repository contains; code of program , screenshots while it is processing , and Assignment's description.

Program takes inputs from file or console (data by data) by user's decision. And then creates a list that keeping given datas. And there are some rules to progress while that goes on. You can read "Assignment_1.pdf" for more details.

You can easily understand program's run logic from comments where is written in the .c file. And there are some paint drawings about functions I coded. After all you can always send me e-mails about this repository.
